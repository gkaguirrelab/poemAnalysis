I don't agree with the conventional wisdom, based on old studies, that says medication causes rebound migraines. MORE IMPORTANTLY, even if overuse does cause headaches....who can tell the difference? And which days of my life should be sacrificed while I hold off on medication? The real problem is that both doctors and insurance companies have bought into this so much that it's very hard for folks to be adequately medicated and have a decent quality of life. I've yet to see any evidence that any of these medications are dangerous or cause harm if used more frequently except possibly for additional headaches.....which is hard to prove for certain. I'd like to see more research in this area and realistic recommendations for increasing quality of life for patients with 15 or more headaches a month who are maxed out on both preventive and abortive medications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought I was going blind the first time I had an aura. The headaches first came around my menstrual cycle and were debilitating.  The ones with auras were always the worst. I discovered triggers and adjusted my diet to avoid the consequences. I was never allowed oral birth contraceptives because of the auras so I was looking forward to menopause until I was informed my headache may get worse.  Worse they got in frequency and light sensitivity.  With that being said I would like research done on the hormone connection and possible therapies to circumvent the headaches. My eyes are blue so they are sensitive to begin with but maybe some research in how to protect light sensitive patients. Glasses are a solution but not practical for 24 hours a day.  I would like to see research into what damage the migraine is actually doing to the brain. I’ve been told by my neurologist that every time I have a migraine I could be getting brain damage.  I’ve refused some treatments because the side effect seem worse than the headaches.  I’m very happy with the advancements in the treatment of migraines. When I  was diagnosed in the early 80s I was referred to a psychologist and given Blood pressure  meds and caffeine pills.  Forty years later I’m still having migraines but now I work with a neurologist and try to keep informed about new treatments. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
